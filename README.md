# Tic-Tac-Toe


**Key Components**:
1. **Class Initialization**: Sets up the Tkinter window and initializes a 3x3 grid of buttons.
2. **Button Creation**: Creates a grid of buttons, each with a click event handler.
3. **Button Click Handling**: Updates the button with the current player's symbol, checks for a win or draw, and toggles the player.
4. **Win Checking**: Checks rows, columns, and diagonals for a win condition.
5. **Game Reset**: Clears the board and starts a new game after a win or draw.

**Functionality**: Players take turns clicking buttons to place "X" or "O". The game announces a winner or a draw and then resets.
